<p>
Seven days later, we're back with another release. This one only gives a couple of bugfixes, mainly <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1077173">the groups traceback</a> that <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/dnf-0.4.18-1.fc20">stopped 0.4.18 from making F20 updates</a>.
<p>

<p>
Let's hope this release is less buggy. It also ships our own gettext .mo files so translations will work as they are supposed to. We're on <a href="http://dnf.baseurl.org/2014/03/03/dnf-is-on-transifex/">transifex</a> too.

<p><a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id30">Release notes</a> have been published and Fedora builds are being cooked right now.</a>
