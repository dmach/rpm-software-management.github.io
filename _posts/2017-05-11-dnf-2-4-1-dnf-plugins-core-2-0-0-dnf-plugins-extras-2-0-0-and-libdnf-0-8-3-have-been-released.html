The main aspect of the release is movement of several plugins from dnf-plugins-extras to dnf-plugins-core that became a part of core package or a separate sub-package. The release also provides new dnf option <strong><strong>-</strong>-enableplugin=</strong> , new option <strong><strong>-</strong>-userinstalled</strong> for <em>REPOQUERY</em>, and enables auto-detection of releasever from host if <strong><strong>-</strong>-releasever=/</strong> is used. Additionally it fixes over 14 bugs in whole DNF stack, like a performance issue of <em>VERSIONLOCK</em> plugin, and added progress bar for download packages from command-line.
