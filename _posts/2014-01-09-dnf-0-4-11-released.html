After the <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/users/2013-December/443694.html">Fedora Users Mailing List announcement</a> last month we're releasing dnf-0.4.11 today. The release fixes many of the bugs from the pile that came in after the announcement.
</p>

<p>
In another thread on the <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel">Development discussions ML</a>, DNF received both critique and praise for the way it treats (or rather does not treat) <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/cli_vs_yum.html#dnf-erase-kernel-deletes-all-packages-called-kernel">the kernel package in a special way</a>. Since the topic escalated into emotional arguing very fast (over 110 emails in three days), the team decided to let the situation cool off for some time while looking for a consistent and user-friendly resolution, if any will be needed.
</p>

<p>
The new release also brings new API features, this time all of them are in one way or the other related to writing plugins. Please come check out the <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id22">release notes</a>.

<p>
Happy packaging in 2014.
