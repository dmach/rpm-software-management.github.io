We would like to invite you to <a title="DNF API hackfest session at DevConf" href="http://sched.co/2C2k">DNF API hackfest session at DevConf</a> which will be held on Sunday, February 8 at 10:40. The session is especially for the ones whose application is currently using yum/yum-utils and need to change the backend to DNF or for anyone who tries to write DNF plugin from scratch. You will have great opportunity to ask DNF developers for technical help.

See you there.
Your DNF team
