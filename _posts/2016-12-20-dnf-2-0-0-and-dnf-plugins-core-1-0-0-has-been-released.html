DNF-2.0 has been released! The next major version release of DNF brings many user experience improvements such as better dependency problem reporting messages, weak dependencies shown in transaction summary, more intuitive help usage invoking and <a href="http://dnf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release_notes.html#release-notes">others</a>. Repoquery plugin has been moved into DNF itself. Whole DNF stack release fixes over 60 bugs. DNF-2.0 release is focused on improving yum compatibility i.e. treat yum configuration options the same (`include`, `includepkgs` and `exclude`). Unfortunately this release is not fully compatible with DNF-1. See the list of <a href="http://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dnf-1_vs_dnf-2.html">DNF-1 and DNF-2 incompatible changes</a>. Authors of dnf plugins will need to check compatibility of their plugins with <a href="http://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases.html#plugins-cli-api">the new DNF argument parser</a>. For complete list of changes see <a href="http://dnf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release_notes.html#release-notes">DNF</a> and <a href="http://dnf-plugins-core.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release_notes.html#release-notes">plugins release</a> notes.
