I am pleased to announce you that DNF team updated main wiki pages on fedoraproject.org to be relevant and up-to-date for DNF (Yum procedures are still described there but could be outdated). Moreover in System Administrators Guide for F22 and up on docs.fedoraproject.org, yum commands were replaced with DNF command alternatives.

If you find wiki page, which you consider as crucial and targets yum only, report it or rewrite it by yourself. Thanks.
