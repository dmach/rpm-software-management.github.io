We are glad to announce the launch of continuous integration job for DNF. Each change now starts the bunch of DNF tests on top of upstream versions of <a title="hawkey" href="https://github.com/akozumpl/hawkey/">hawkey</a>, <a title="librepo" href="https://github.com/Tojaj/librepo/">librepo</a> and <a title="libcomps" href="https://github.com/midnightercz/libcomps/">libcomps</a>.

It also means that from now nightly builds of DNF and its dependencies are available to you. Download them at will from <a href="http://jenkins.cloud.fedoraproject.org/job/DNF/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/" target="_blank">http://jenkins.cloud.fedoraproject.org/job/DNF/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/</a>. To check presence of new builds please follow the RSS channel <a href="http://jenkins.cloud.fedoraproject.org/job/DNF/rssAll" target="_blank">http://jenkins.cloud.fedoraproject.org/job/DNF/rssAll</a>. You should also be able to use that source as a DNF/yum repository.
