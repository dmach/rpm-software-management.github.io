<p>
0.5.1 is out, a minor thing this time. Users should be pleased that the CLI no longer spews tens and hundreds of lines about dependency processing and DRPM downloads now report nice stats about <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1065882">how much bandwidth was saved</a>.
</p>

<p>Hear the <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id32">0.5.1 release notes</a>. And since there was no significant outcry about 0.5.0 in Rawhide, the Fedora 20 release of 0.5.1 is on its way.</p>
