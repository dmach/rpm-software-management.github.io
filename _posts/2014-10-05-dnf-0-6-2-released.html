The DNF version 0.6.2 contains mostly bug fixes, improves database  locking mechanism and does not request fresh metadata for every command. More information in <a href="http://rpm-software-management.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id39">release notes</a>.

This is the last version of DNF under the lead of Ales Kozumplik - hopefully not the last stable/usable version of DNF. Thanks Ales for your hard work and knowledge you gave us.
