Good news, everyone. New version of DNF and DNF-PLUGINS-CORE was built for F22 and F23. The documentation of yum and DNF differences was extended by <a href="http://dnf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cli_vs_yum.html#changes-in-dnf-plugins-compared-to-yum-plugins">yum plugin alternatives part</a> and <em>erase</em> command  was deprecated in favor of <em>remove</em> command name. DNF is getting more and more stable with 20 bug fixes while DNF-PLUGINS-CORE 0.1.6 newly adds <a href="http://dnf-plugins-core.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config_manager.html">Config manager</a>.

With regard to packaging changes, DNF is running on Python 3 from F23 and dnf-yum compatible subpackage does not conflict with yum anymore.
