It looks like the Core Plugins have stabilized over the last few months so I decided it's time to give them more independent releases with proper <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf-plugins-core/release_notes.html#id2">release notes</a>. It is my pleasure to announce 0.1.0 today adding <code>dnf repoquery</code> plugin and a bugfix to <code>dnf builddep</code>.

If you're not familiar with DNF Core Plugins, make sure to check out <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf-plugins-core/"">our new documentation</a> too, perhaps there are plugins you miss and don't know that exist. The name of the package in Fedora is still <code>dnf-plugins-core</code>.
