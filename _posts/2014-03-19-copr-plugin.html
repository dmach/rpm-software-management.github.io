<p>
New dnf-plugins-core introduces new <a href="http://copr.fedoraproject.org/">copr</a> plugin.
</p>

<p>
You can list projects of some user:

<pre>
  # dnf copr list bkabrda
  ==================== List of bkabrda coprs =====================
  bkabrda/python27rebuild : Collection with Python 2.7 for EPEL 6
                          : (currently just for testing).
  bkabrda/python-3.4 : Testing repository for Python 3.4 that is
                     : supposed to go to F21. 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
We have plan for generic search function as well, but it will land in some future version.
</p>

<p>
You can easily enable some project:

<pre>
 # dnf copr enable bkabrda/python-3.4 fedora-20-x86_64

 You are going to enable Copr repository. Please note that this repository is not
 part of Fedora distribution and may have various quality. Fedora distribution
 have no power over this repository and can not enforce some quality or security
 level.

 Please do not file bug reports about this packages in Fedora Bugzilla.
 In case of problems you should contact owner of this repository.

 Do you want to continue? [y/N]: y 
 Repository successfully enabled.
</pre></p>

<p>
You can even omit last argument and it will be guessed. But currently there is know bug, which will
be fixed in next release, therefore you need to specify chroot.
This command will download repo file and save it as <code>/etc/yum.repos.d/_copr_bkabrda-python-3.4.repo</code>
</p>

<p>
You can disable project:
<pre>
 # dnf copr disable bkabrda/python-3.4 
 Repository successfully disabled.
</pre>

which will remove previously downloaded repo file.
