<p>
dnf-0.4.2 was released in <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/librepo-1.2.0-1.fc20,hawkey-0.4.2-1.git4c51f65.fc20,dnf-0.4.2-1.gitc1716d7.fc20?_csrf_token=a3df81e082285c7e90a3e2e543a0e3ed8e8d1375">Fedora 20</a> and Fedora Rawhide today.
</p>

<p>
The highlights of the release are parallel downloads, detecting the fastest mirrors for downloads, support for <code>repo.cost</code> config option (which has been in Yum for a long time and we are adding it to DNF again now) and losing the urlgrabber dependency. See the <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id13">full release notes</a> on the documentation page.
