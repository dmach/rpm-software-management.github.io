Another stability release of DNF and DNF-PLUGINS-CORE has been made. This release should eliminate the most critical bugs, especially the Unicode tracebacks and COPR plugin should work in Korora again. More information about the release can be found in <a href="http://dnf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release_notes.html#release-notes">DNF</a> and <a href="http://dnf-plugins-core.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release_notes.html#release-notes">plugins release</a> notes.
