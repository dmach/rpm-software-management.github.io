If you often build packages from source RPM or even from the upstream checkout then we've got good news: the <a href="http://yum.baseurl.org/gitweb?p=yum-utils.git;a=blob;f=yum-builddep.py;hb=HEAD">builddep plugin from yum-utils</a> has been ported to DNF and <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/dnf-plugins-core-0.0.4-1.fc20">released for Fedora today</a>. <b>Edit:</b> The plugin is only added to the Fedora package in version <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/dnf-plugins-core-0.0.5-2.fc20">0.0.5</a>.
</p>

<p>
Given a .spec file or an .srpm, the builddep command fetches all of its dependencies, like:
</p>

<p>
<code>
dnf builddep ~/Downloads/librepo-1.5.2-2.fc20.src.rpm
</code></p>

<p>
offers a transaction that installs everything needed so that <code>rpmbuild --rebuild ~/Downloads/librepo-1.5.2-2.fc20.src.rpm</code> does what it's supposed to and doesn't halt on dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Another useful plugin we moved to dnf-plugins-core recently is <b>debuginfo-install</b>. For a given package it downloads all relevant debuginfo packages, so that debugging a core dump or other problem with it in gdb gives readable, decoded tracebacks and other information, like for instance:
</p>

<p><code>
dnf debuginfo-install python-librepo
</p></code>

<p>There's <a href="http://yum.baseurl.org/wiki/YumUtils/DebugInfoInstall">documentation for the Yum util command</a>, we're still behind on proper documentation in DNF.</p>

<p>Hope you'll find the new plugins useful.</p>
