Hi! The 0.4.9 has just been released, and the build is already on its way to <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/dnf-0.4.9-1.fc20">Fedora 20 testing</a> and <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id20">release notes are online</a>.
</p>

<p>
What's new? Plenty! We finally support <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/api_plugins.html">plugins</a>. The interface looks poor so far as we rushed to get the release out, but it already can be used to <a href="https://github.com/akozumpl/dnf-plugins/blob/master/plugins/noroot.py">implement</a> a big <b>HALT</b> when a non-root tries to run an RPMDB-changing command (like <code>dnf upgrade</code>).
</p>

<p>
Doing <code>history rollback</code> is supported again. So is <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=884615">printing out just the installed packages selected by user</a>. Can come in handy when moving to Fedora 20, no?
</p>

<p>
Another addition we were often asked for was a way to support replacing a package with a conflicting package <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=963137">without disturbing any packages depending on these</a>. This DNF version supplies the <code>--allowerasing</code> switch to facilitate just that.
</p>

<p>
On top of that a couple of bugs and a couple of API extensions. The <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id20">release notes</a> mention them all.
