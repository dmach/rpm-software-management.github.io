I'd like to announce new team leader of DNF project as I decided to accept new challenges in a different environment.

From May 1 <a href="https://github.com/dmach">Daniel Mach</a> will be officially new team lead of the project. He came from release engineer background and has been consumer of DNF for a long time. Because of  his knowledge of the ecosystem and ability to push things forward I believe he will fit into this role well.

I will still keep an eye on the project but now more like its user and occasional contributor. Thank you all who cooperated to make DNF better.
