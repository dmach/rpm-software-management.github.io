<p>
Since <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=850912">advisories listing</a> and the updateinfo command are kind of a big deal for our users, we mark the first DNF to support it with a new minor release number: 0.6.0.
</p>

<p>Other notable improvements: added <code>include</code> configuration support and listing pending group operations.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id37">release notes</a> are posted and those who like to experiment with frisky Fedora pre-releases can try out dnf-0.6.0 in Fedora 21.</p>
