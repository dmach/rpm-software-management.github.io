<p>
So you are seeing an error that looks similar to:
</p>

<p>
<code>
--> Starting dependency resolution
--> Finished dependency resolution
Error: package kernel-modules-extra-3.13.0-0.rc0.git3.2.fc21.i686 requires kernel-uname-r = 3.13.0-0.rc0.git3.2.fc21.i686, but none of the providers can be installed
</code>
</p>

<p>
In some cases this means a package can not be installed because it is missing some of its dependencies (i.e. DNF does not see them in any enabled repository). It can also mean a bug in the depsolving machinery. If you suspect that is the case, <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&component=dnf">open a bugzilla</a>, of course, but also execute the failing run again with <code>--debugsolver</code> added on the command line and attach the <code>debugdata/</code> directory that will be created after the failure under the current working directory.
</p>

<p>
Typically one would use a line similar to:
</p>

<p>
<code>$ sudo dnf --debugsolver upgrade</code>
</p>

<p>
It is OK to zip the data or upload it somewhere public instead of the slow bugzilla (expect the zipped directory to be between five and ten megabytes). Also, if the bug is about a kernel depsolving problem we'll also need to know the particular version of kernel you are running, e.g.:
</p>

<code>
$ uname -r
3.11.100-100.fc19.x86_64
</code>

<p>
Be prepared to sometimes be told that the problem is in your particular system or that the repositories are broken. Thanks for helping us in any case.
</p>
