We've been busy pulling things apart on the master branch and taking a longer cycle then usual for the next DNF release, which will be labeled 0.5.0 and will bring more changes than usual this time.
<p>

<p>
The idea was that 0.4.19 in F20 is solid enough to stay current for some time, but there is a <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1082230">critical bug</a> that several people has run into with <code>dnf history info &lt;id&gt;</code>. That's why I decided to start the <a href="https://github.com/akozumpl/dnf/commits/0.4">0.4 branch</a> and stay with it in Fedora Rawhide until 0.5 is ready and in Fedora 20 until 0.5 is stable. The next F20 build is thus <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/dnf-0.4.20-1.fc20">0.4.20</a>, available at all the good repos now.
</p>

<p>
That is not to say that things are unstable in upstream DNF. Contrary, with more eyes looking and the <a href="http://jenkins.cloud.fedoraproject.org/job/DNF/">CI spinning nonstop</a> we're more stable then ever.
