<p>
Are you missing your favorite Yum feature in DNF? Or you thought of an entirely new one? Just CC yourself on those feature requests and bugs that you'd prefer get fixed first and we'll notice. It also works for those bugs that we originally <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=910133">decided not to fix.</a>
</p>

There's a bugzilla query showing <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&classification=Fedora&component=dnf&list_id=1880873&product=Fedora&query_format=advanced">all opened DNF bugs</a> and if a particular request is missing be sure to <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora&component=dnf">open one</a>.
