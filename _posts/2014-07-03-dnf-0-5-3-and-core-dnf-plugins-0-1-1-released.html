<p>
Hello, after one month the team is releasing a new version of DNF and its core plugins. We're still getting reports of problems with Unicode and translations and the current release does away with many of them.
</p>

<p>
People on older and special networks will appreciate addition of the <code>-4</code> CLI switch to force IPv4 DNS resolving.
</p>

<p>
Besides that, the focus in DNF was on extending the API to enable implementation of the popularly demanded <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf-plugins-core/protected_packages.html">protected_packages</a> plugin. The plugin works by checking a resolved transaction and stopping it immediately in cases where an explicitly protected package or the running kernel should get removed.
</p>
