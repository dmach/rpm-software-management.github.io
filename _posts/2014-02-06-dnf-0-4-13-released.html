We are announcing this release just a day prior to the start of the <a href="http://devconf.cz/">Brno DevConf</a> this Saturday. The release (or its nightly peer or a successor) will be used during my <a href="http://developerconference2014.sched.org/event/42e270220a0e46e523be97aa3d818807?iframe=no#.UvO395WW_SU">DNF API lab on Saturday</a>.
</p>

<p>
Should you not be at the event to try out some hacking on it, the release still offers plenty: Delta RPM support, bash completion and re-added <code>keepcache</code> config option.
</p>

<p>
An annoying and often complained-about bug of <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1056400">installing local/URL-given RPMs</a> is gone too. See <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id24">the release notes.</a>

Some Fedora releng issues prevent us to do the synchronous Fedora 20 release again, doh, but the rawhide version is on the mirrors already. <b>Edit:</b>The <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/dnf-0.4.13-2.fc20">update</a> is ready now.
