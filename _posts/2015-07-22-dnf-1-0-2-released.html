Finally there's the new release of DNF which fixes the bugs which were highly demanded from Fedora community (former yum users). When a transaction is not successfully finished DNF preserves downloaded packages until the next successful transaction. The resolution configuration hints are printed to the output and user is notified which packages were skipped during update in case there are conflicts. The new <em>--repofrompath </em>switch was added and <a href="http://dnf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release_notes.html#release-notes">many more</a>.
