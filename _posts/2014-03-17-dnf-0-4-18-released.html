The new release is making its way to Fedora mirrors as I write this. <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id29">The notes are up.</a>
<p>

<p>
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=963710">Distro-syncing specific subsets of packages</a> is finally here. Also 0.4.18 marks the move to objectified groups, something Yum did in 2012. Things might look a bit shaky on the groups front for some time while the precise semantics settles but the basic operations work and support for installing <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1067136">optional packages</a> has been added again. Moreover, the changes provide new API that allows the DNF Anaconda payload to <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/api_base.html#dnf.Base.group_install">exclude packages from transaction as the user wishes</a>.
</p>

<p>
API also sees some spring cleaning of parts that we've deprecated and kept in the cellar since last December.
