<p>
As I will be moving on to work on other things beyond Linux software management soon, I decided to step down as a leader of the project.
</p>

<p>
The new leader of the project is <a href="https://github.com/jsilhan/">Jan Šilhan</a>, the change is effective as of today. Jan is a talented, result-oriented software developer and I am convinced he is just the right type for the job.
</p>

<p>
It has been exciting and fun three years and a big thanks to all of you who contributed, consulted, supported or generally shared the ride.
