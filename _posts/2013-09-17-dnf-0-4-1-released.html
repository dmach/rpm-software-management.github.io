A new version of DNF was built for <a href="http://bit.ly/1bmJ3Hv" title="F20">Fedora 20</a> and Rawhide yesterday. It fixes a couple of bugs, improves support for Anaconda to foster the development of DNFPayload there and starts on the project to get us rid of urlgrabber dependency en route to Py3. Please check out the <a href="http://akozumpl.github.io/dnf/release_notes.html#id12">release notes</a>.

This is the first release with contributions from two new members of the DNF team: Radek Holy &lt;rholy@redhat.com&gt; and Jan Silhan &lt;jsilhan@redhat.com&gt;. Radek is currently working on the support for transaction undoing/reverting and Jan has added <a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/rpminfo?rpmID=4411240 ">support for Python3 to hawkey</a> and is going to start moving DNF to Python3 too.
