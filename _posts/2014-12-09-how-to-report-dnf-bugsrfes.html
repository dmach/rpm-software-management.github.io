In <a title="following page" href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf/wiki/Bug-Reporting">following page</a> is described the classification of common DNF bugs, what information to provide for each of  them and what to attach. By filling right the bug reports you not only save time of DNF developers but you could raise the priority of your issue and eliminate wasteful delay of asking for additional problem description from us.

Thanks for properly filled bug reports so we can spend more time to fix your issues.
